# Differential fuzzing: Go ClassAd vs. C++ libclassad

This directory contains a differential fuzzing harness that finds behavioral
differences between the two ClassAd evaluation engines available in this
container:

- **Go** — the native implementation in [`../classad`](../classad).
- **C++** — HTCondor's reference `libclassad` (the same library the `classad2`
  Python bindings and the `classad_eval` CLI wrap).

Both engines parse the *same* ClassAd, evaluate *every* top-level attribute, and
encode the results into a common [canonical form](canon/canon.go). The harness
then compares the two and reports any divergence.

## Why in-process (cgo), not a subprocess

The C++ engine is reached **in-process via cgo** ([`oracle/cgo`](oracle/cgo)),
not by shelling out to `classad_eval` or a Python worker. `libclassad` is a C++
library, so a small `extern "C"` shim ([`shim.cc`](oracle/cgo/shim.cc)) bridges
the C ABI that cgo speaks to the C++ ClassAd API; cgo compiles and links it
automatically. This means one Go process parses and evaluates in *both* engines
with no IPC or process-startup overhead, which is what makes coverage-guided
fuzzing run at thousands of execs/second.

Trade-off: because `libclassad` shares the process, a hard crash there
(segfault/abort) takes the fuzzer down. The shim catches all C++ exceptions, and
`cafuzz -journal` records the current input before each evaluation so a crash
leaves a reproducer. A C++ crash is itself a finding.

### Build requirements

- `condor-devel` (provides `/usr/include/classad/*.h`) — already in the
  [devcontainer Dockerfile](../.devcontainer/Dockerfile).
- Unversioned `libclassad.so` and `libcondor_utils.so` symlinks for the linker
  (the Dockerfile creates both). The cgo link uses these unversioned names, so
  it does not hard-code an HTCondor version; the versioned SONAME is still what
  the binary loads at runtime.
- `CGO_ENABLED=1` and a C++20 compiler (the headers use `operator<=>`).

Because those requirements are not present on a stock CI runner, everything that
links `libclassad` — the [`oracle/cgo`](oracle/cgo) package, the
[`differ`](differ), [`cmd/cafuzz`](cmd/cafuzz), and the `FuzzDifferential` /
`TestCppQuirks` tests — is behind the **`libclassad` build tag**. A plain
`go build ./...` / `go test ./...` (as CI runs) simply skips those packages; the
pure-Go pieces ([`canon`](canon), [`gen`](gen), `cmd/genseeds`) still build and
test everywhere. To include the C++ engine, pass `-tags libclassad` (as the
commands below do); the devcontainer has everything the tag needs.

## Components

| Path | Role |
|------|------|
| [`canon/`](canon) | Canonical, engine-independent value encoding + tolerant compare. The lingua franca both engines emit. |
| [`oracle/cgo/`](oracle/cgo) | The C++ engine: `extern "C"` shim over `libclassad` + cgo bindings. |
| [`differ/`](differ) | Runs one ClassAd through both engines and classifies the outcome. |
| [`gen/`](gen) | Grammar-directed random ClassAd generator (deterministic per seed). |
| [`cmd/cafuzz/`](cmd/cafuzz) | Standalone driver: generate/replay ads, bucket & report all divergences. |
| [`cmd/genseeds/`](cmd/genseeds) | Regenerates `corpus/seeds.txt`. |
| [`differential_test.go`](differential_test.go) | `FuzzDifferential`, the Go-native coverage-guided target. |

## The canonical encoding

Direct string comparison of engine output is hopeless — Go prints reals as
`0.5` and lists as `[1 2 3]`, while `libclassad` prints `5.0E-01` and
`{ 1,2,3 }`. Instead both engines encode each evaluated value into a compact,
self-delimiting line (see the doc comment in [`canon/canon.go`](canon/canon.go))
that captures **type and value** but not formatting. Comparison is:

1. exact string match (the common case), then
2. a structural compare with a tight float tolerance (`1e-12`) to absorb
   last-ULP differences from `libm`.

The `int` vs `real` distinction is preserved and significant — `int(1)` and
`real(1.0)` are *not* equal, because conflating them would hide a whole class of
ClassAd bugs.

## Usage

### Bulk survey — `cafuzz`

The primary discovery tool. Generates random ads, evaluates in both engines,
and prints divergences bucketed by signature (so one bug isn't reported a
thousand times):

```sh
# 100k generated ads from seed 1
CGO_ENABLED=1 go run -tags libclassad ./fuzz/cmd/cafuzz -n 100000

# focus on evaluation semantics, ignore known parser grammar differences
CGO_ENABLED=1 go run -tags libclassad ./fuzz/cmd/cafuzz -n 100000 -ignore-parse

# replay a corpus file, one ad per line
CGO_ENABLED=1 go run -tags libclassad ./fuzz/cmd/cafuzz -corpus fuzz/corpus/seeds.txt

# inspect a single ad in both engines
CGO_ENABLED=1 go run -tags libclassad ./fuzz/cmd/cafuzz -ad '[ a = 1 / 2 ]'

# crash-reproducer journaling (for hunting libclassad crashes)
CGO_ENABLED=1 go run -tags libclassad ./fuzz/cmd/cafuzz -n 1000000 -journal /tmp/last.ad
```

`cafuzz` exits non-zero if any divergence is found.

### Coverage-guided — `go test -fuzz`

```sh
# explore from a matching baseline; saves any divergence to testdata/fuzz/
CGO_ENABLED=1 go test -tags libclassad ./fuzz -run='xxx' -fuzz='FuzzDifferential' -fuzztime=60s

# re-run a saved finding
CGO_ENABLED=1 go test -tags libclassad ./fuzz -run='FuzzDifferential/<hash>'
```

The fuzz target seeds itself only with inputs the engines currently *agree* on
(Go's fuzzer aborts on a failing seed before it mutates), so mutation explores
from green and reports regressions. It fails on `ValueDivergence` and on a Go
engine panic. Parse-only divergences are left to `cafuzz`.

### Regenerating the seed corpus

```sh
CGO_ENABLED=1 go run ./fuzz/cmd/genseeds > fuzz/corpus/seeds.txt
```

## Divergence categories

- **value-divergence** — both parsed; an attribute evaluated differently. The
  prize.
- **parse-divergence** — exactly one engine accepted the input. Often reflects
  known grammar differences; `-ignore-parse` suppresses these.
- **go-panic** — the Go engine panicked. Always a Go bug (it should return
  `error`/`undefined`, never panic).
- **encoding-error** — an engine emitted something the canonical decoder
  rejected (harness/engine bug).

## Findings from the first runs

These were found within seconds and confirmed independently against the
`classad_eval` reference CLI — they are real engine differences, not harness
artifacts. **All of the rows below have since been fixed in the Go engine** (see
the `classad:` / `parser:` commits and `classad/cpp_parity_test.go`):

| Input | Go (before) | C++ | Nature |
|-------|----|----|--------|
| `1 / 2` | `real(0.5)` | `int(0)` | Integer division for integer operands. |
| `"B" < "a"` | `true` | `false` | Case-insensitive string ordering. **Silent wrong boolean.** |
| `true < false` | `error` | `false` | Booleans are orderable numbers (1/0). |
| `6/3`, `1.0/2.0` | parse error | parses | Lexer dropped a char after `/` adjacent to a digit. |
| `false && error` | `error` | `false` | Three-valued short-circuit logic. |
| `{}[0]` | `undefined` | `error` | Out-of-range list subscript is an error. |
| `1 ? a : b` | `error` | `a` | Ternary condition coerces a number's truthiness. |
| `0.1 + 0.2 == 0.3` | `true` | `false` | Reals compare with exact (not epsilon) equality. |
| `round(2.5)` | `3` | `2` | Round half to even. |
| `string(1.5)` | `"1.5"` | `"1.50…E+00"` | Reals stringify as `%.15E`. |

…and many more found by driving the fuzzer iteratively (see the `classad:`
commits and `classad/cpp_parity_test.go`): boolean numeric coercion, per-function
undefined handling, `ifThenElse`/`?:` condition coercion, exact real equality,
mismatched-type `==` → error, `quantize`/`pow` typing, integer division/modulo
overflow, `int()`/`real()`/`floor()`/`pow()`/… string parsing, `member()`
`==`-semantics, `=?=`/`=!=` on lists → error, undefined-dominates-error argument
precedence (`substr`/`strcmp`/`member`), real division by zero (`+Inf`→error,
`-Inf`/`NaN`→value), large-integer `round`/`floor` precision, list coercion via
the sink unparse format, and removing the non-reference `length()`.

The bucketed `cafuzz` survey, plus a harness-bug fix and the list refactor
(below), drove the semantic-divergence rate over random generated ads
(`-ignore-parse`) to **0 in 240,000** *for the generator as it stood then*.
Coverage-guided mutation (`go test -fuzz`) then found further operator/function
gaps the generator does not emit, which were also fixed (bitwise operators,
case-insensitive function names, `substr` negative/out-of-range offsets,
duplicate attribute names, and cyclic references — see the `classad:` commits).

A second, deeper round of coverage-guided mutation drove out a family of
*lazy-evaluation* and *parsing* divergences (all with regression tests in
`cpp_parity_test.go`):

- **Lazy list values.** A list value is its unevaluated element expressions
  (like the reference's `ExprList`): a subscript evaluates only the indexed
  element, `size()` counts without evaluating, and a self-referential list is a
  value rather than a construction-time error.
- **Short-circuit / lazy operators.** `&&`/`||` evaluate the right operand only
  when the left does not decide the result; `ifThenElse` and `?:` evaluate only
  the taken branch — except a `?:` with an *undefined* condition evaluates
  *both* branches; `strcat` stops at its first undefined/error argument.
- **Unknown / wrong-arity calls** are an error *without* evaluating arguments
  (an `functionArity` table checks arity before evaluation); `sum()/avg()/min()/max()`
  with no argument are error.
- **List projection.** `list.attr` maps the select over each element
  (`{[A=1],[A=2]}.A` is `{1,2}`).
- **Parsing.** Adjacent `?:` is a high-precedence postfix elvis operator (so
  `10 ?: 2 + 3` is `13`); single-quoted attribute names (`'a b'`) are supported;
  a `=!`/`=?` that is not `=!=`/`=?=` no longer drops the following character;
  explicit parentheses are preserved through an `ast.ParenExpr` node when
  unparsing.
- **Cyclic-reference handling** matched where libclassad is self-consistent: a
  cyclic function argument propagates (the call errors), a cyclic list-literal
  element is localized to that element's error, and a cyclic projection
  propagates. Where libclassad is *not* self-consistent (it hangs or behaves
  differently by syntactic path), the cases are recorded in
  [`CPP_QUIRKS.md`](CPP_QUIRKS.md) rather than mirrored.

Coverage-guided mutation can still surface non-reproducing flaky failures whose
saved input is a parse error in both engines or a libclassad cyclic hang; these
are a consequence of fuzzing an in-process engine that can infinite-loop, not Go
bugs (see the cyclic-hang note below and `CPP_QUIRKS.md`). The single-process
`cafuzz` survey is the reliable divergence counter.

#### A harness bug, not a Go bug

Much of what first *looked* like an "architectural list" divergence
(~35/5000) was actually a bug in this fuzzer's C++ oracle: it encoded a list
value by evaluating each element with the static
`ClassAd::EvaluateExpr(ad, tree, val)`, which cannot set the parent scope, so a
bare attribute reference inside a list element (`result = {{a0}[0], 99}`)
wrongly evaluated to `undefined` instead of resolving against the ad. The Go
engine was *correct*. Fixed by reconnecting the list's parent scope before
evaluating elements (`shim.cc`). Lesson: when a differential harness reaches
into one engine's internals, it can manufacture divergences — verify surprising
ones against the real CLI (`classad_eval`).

#### The list refactor

String coercion of a list/nested-ad with non-literal elements once differed
(`string({1, 1+1})` is `"{ 1,1 + 1 }"` in the reference — the *source*
expression — but Go had only the evaluated value). This is now matched: list
values carry their source element expressions ([`classad/evaluator.go`](../classad/evaluator.go)),
the parser preserves explicit parentheses, and a reference-faithful expression
unparser ([`classad/unparse.go`](../classad/unparse.go), a port of `sink.cpp`)
renders them. Value semantics still use the eagerly-evaluated elements.

#### The extension-function round

The earlier "0 in 240,000" was reached with a generator that did not exercise
HTCondor's *extension* functions (`split`, `stringList*`, `join`,
`versioncmp`/`version_in_range`, `interval`, …) or hex/`inf`/`nan` string
literals. Two changes opened that surface:

- The shim now calls `ClassAdReconfig()` (linking `libcondor_utils`) so
  libclassad registers HTCondor's extension functions; without it the reference
  lacked them and produced *false* divergences ([`oracle/cgo/shim.cc`](oracle/cgo/shim.cc)).
- The generator's alphabet and builtin lists were widened (hex/`inf`/`nan`
  strings, ~57 builtins) ([`gen/gen.go`](gen/gen.go)).

That surfaced ~1,900 real divergences, all since fixed and regression-tested in
`cpp_parity_test.go`:

- **`split`** splits on commas *and* whitespace, with hard (non-whitespace)
  delimiters producing empty fields (`split("a,,b")` is `{"a","","b"}`).
- **`stringList*`** tokenize on comma + space (not comma alone), drop empty
  tokens, and take a *delimiter* set as their optional trailing argument;
  `stringListMember`/`stringListIMember`'s third argument is that delimiter, not
  a case option (case is fixed by the function name).
- **`join`** coerces its separator/items to strings, skips undefined items, and
  is undefined (not `""`) when no items contribute and the separator is undefined.
- **`versioncmp`** is a faithful port of `natural_cmp.cpp` (strverscmp-style,
  including its leading/trailing-zero handling).
- **`interval`** truncates to a signed 32-bit second count and formats a
  negative magnitude with a leading `-`.
- **`sum`/`avg`/`min`/`max`** skip undefined elements, coerce booleans to
  numbers, preserve a *lone* boolean element's type, and accumulate integer sums
  in `int64` so they stay exact past 2^53.

This drove the rate back to **0 divergences across 360,000** generated ads
(12 seeds × 30k, `-ignore-parse`). The one residual — a whitespace-only string
treated as a non-empty list by `stringListSubsetMatch` — is an internal
libclassad inconsistency that the Go engine now mirrors for parity; its
reference value is pinned by `TestCppQuirks` in
[`oracle/cgo/quirks_test.go`](oracle/cgo/quirks_test.go) so a future libclassad
change is caught (see [`CPP_QUIRKS.md`](CPP_QUIRKS.md)).

### Known remaining divergences

- **Nested-ad parent-scope resolution.** A nested ad literal that selects an
  attribute resolving up its parent scope chain into a cycle —
  `[A = [].A]` — is `error` in the reference (it resolves `.A` to the parent's
  cyclic `A`) but `undefined` in Go (select only looks in the immediate ad).
  Matching it needs nested-ad scope-chain resolution plus cross-scope cycle
  detection; the case is pathological (cyclic) and left for a focused
  follow-up. (`[B = [].A]` and other non-cyclic selects already match.)
- **Non-UTF-8 string literals.** The Go lexer decodes string literals as UTF-8
  (an invalid byte becomes the 3-byte U+FFFD) while libclassad keeps raw bytes.
  `FuzzDifferential` skips non-UTF-8 inputs; ClassAd source is text.
- **`length(...)`** *was* a Go alias for `size()`; the reference engine has no
  such function, so it has been removed (now an error), matching the reference.
- **Integer-literal overflow** (`9223372036854775808`): the reference engine
  silently evaluates it to `0` (a libclassad bug, reported upstream); Go rejects
  it at parse time. Not mirrored.
Surprising or likely-buggy libclassad behaviors found along the way are
collected in [`CPP_QUIRKS.md`](CPP_QUIRKS.md) for upstream reporting.

- **libclassad cyclic-evaluation hang** (`[A0 = 0 ? e : A0]`): libclassad
  infinite-loops on a cyclic self-reference reached through a lazy operand (a
  ternary/elvis branch, an unknown call, …) where its cycle guard never fires.
  The Go engine detects the cycle and returns `error`. Since a cgo call cannot
  be interrupted, the harness caps each libclassad evaluation
  (`cppEvalTimeout`); a timeout is reported as the `cpp-timeout` category and
  treated as a non-divergence (the result is uncomparable). A C++ bug, not a Go
  one.

## Extending

- **More operators/functions**: extend the generator in [`gen/gen.go`](gen/gen.go)
  (`binops`, `fns1/2/3`). Keep additions deterministic — no `time`/`random`.
- **A target attribute / matchmaking**: the differ currently evaluates a single
  ad's attributes. To fuzz `TARGET.x` matchmaking, add a second ad to the shim
  (`MatchClassAd` is already linked) and to `canon.FromGoClassAd`.
- **New value kinds**: add a `Kind` in [`canon/canon.go`](canon/canon.go) and emit
  it from both `shim.cc` and `canon/govalue.go`.
