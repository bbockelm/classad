# Surprising libclassad behaviors (for upstream reporting)

Differential fuzzing of the Go ClassAd engine against HTCondor's reference C++
`libclassad` (25.11.0, via the `classad_eval` CLI / `classad2` Python bindings)
surfaced the behaviors below. They are recorded here because they are either
likely C++ bugs or surprising-enough semantics that upstream may want to
confirm or change them. The Go engine was *not* changed to mirror the ones
marked **likely bug**; for the others, the Go engine matches C++ (and the
matching is noted).

Each item gives a minimal reproducer for `classad_eval -quiet '<ad>' '<attr>'`.

---

## 1. Integer-literal overflow silently wraps to 0  — likely bug

```
classad_eval -quiet 9223372036854775808
```

An integer literal that overflows `int64` evaluates to `0` (silently), rather
than being a parse error or a saturated/error value. Reported upstream
previously. The Go engine rejects it at parse time and is intentionally **not**
changed to match.

---

## 2. Infinite loop on a cyclic self-reference reached through a lazy operand — likely bug

```
classad_eval -quiet '[ A0 = 0 ? e : A0 ]' A0        # hangs forever
classad_eval -quiet '[ a = 0 ? e : a ]' a           # hangs forever
```

When an attribute's value reaches a reference to *itself* through a lazily
evaluated operand — the taken branch of a `?:` ternary here — libclassad's
cycle guard never fires and evaluation does not terminate. Contrast with the
direct self-reference, which is detected:

```
classad_eval -quiet '[ A0 = A0 ]' A0                # exception: "failed to evaluate"
```

The Go engine detects all of these as a cyclic reference and returns `error`.
Because libclassad hangs, the differential harness caps each C++ evaluation and
reports a timeout rather than hanging (see `fuzz/README.md`).

---

## 3. Inconsistent cyclic-reference handling: hang vs. exception vs. error — likely bug

The same logical condition (an attribute that transitively references itself)
produces three different outcomes depending on the syntactic path:

```
classad_eval -quiet '[ A0 = A0 ]' A0                          # exception ("failed to evaluate")
classad_eval -quiet '[ A0 = 0 ? e : A0 ]' A0                  # infinite loop (hang)
classad_eval -quiet '[ A0 = undefined ? {} : A0 ]' A0         # exception
classad_eval -quiet '[ A0 = (A ? pow(t) : 0); t = A0 ]' A0    # undefined (cycle never reached: wrong arity, see below)
```

A single, consistent outcome (cycle ⇒ error) would be less surprising. (Through
the `classad2` bindings / the differential shim, the "exception" cases surface
as an `error` value for the attribute rather than a thrown exception.)

---

## 4. A ternary with an *undefined* condition evaluates BOTH branches — surprising

A `true`/`false` condition evaluates only the taken branch (correct
short-circuit):

```
classad_eval -quiet '[ A0 = 1 ? 5 : A0 ]' A0        # 5  (false branch A0 not evaluated)
classad_eval -quiet '[ A0 = 0 ? A0 : 5 ]' A0        # 5  (true branch A0 not evaluated)
```

But an **undefined** condition evaluates *both* branches. The result is still
`undefined`, and an ordinary `error`-valued branch is absorbed, yet a cyclic
self-reference in either branch surfaces:

```
classad_eval -quiet '[ A0 = undefined ? 1 : error ]' A0     # undefined (error branch absorbed)
classad_eval -quiet '[ A0 = undefined ? {} : A0 ]' A0       # fails to evaluate (cyclic branch evaluated!)
classad_eval -quiet '[ A0 = undefined ? A0 : 5 ]' A0        # fails to evaluate
```

So whether a branch is evaluated depends on whether the condition is
`true`/`false` (one branch) versus `undefined` (both). The Go engine matches
this behavior (a cyclic branch becomes `error`), but it is asymmetric and
surprising.

---

## 5. Elvis `?:` precedence depends on whitespace between `?` and `:` — surprising

An **adjacent** `?:` is a high-precedence postfix operator (it binds tighter
than arithmetic); a **spaced** `? :` binds at low ternary precedence:

```
classad_eval -quiet '[ a = 10 ?: 2 + 3 ]' a        # 13   -> (10 ?: 2) + 3
         # 10   -> 10 ?: (2 + 3)
```

Inserting a space between `?` and `:` changes the parse tree (and the result).
This stems from the lexer fusing only an immediately-adjacent `?:` into a single
`LEX_ELVIS` token. The Go engine matches this, but identical-looking
expressions parsing differently by whitespace is surprising.

---

## 6. version comparison functions are camelCase and case-sensitive — surprising

ClassAd function names are otherwise case-insensitive (`SUBSTR` == `substr`), but
the version-comparison helpers are spelled in camelCase and only match that exact
case:

```
classad_eval -quiet '[ a = versionGT("2.0","1.0") ]' a    # true
classad_eval -quiet '[ a = versiongt("2.0","1.0") ]' a    # error  (lowercase not recognized)
classad_eval -quiet '[ a = version_gt("2.0","1.0") ]' a   # error  (underscore not recognized)
```

So `versionGT`/`versionGE`/`versionLT`/`versionLE`/`versionEQ` work, but only with
that capitalization — inconsistent with every other builtin. (`version_in_range`
and `versioncmp` are the lowercase-friendly ones.)

## 7. `stringListSubsetMatch` treats a whitespace-only list as non-empty — inconsistent with `stringListSize`

A whitespace-only string tokenizes to *zero* elements according to
`stringListSize`, but `stringListSubsetMatch` behaves as though it contains a
(non-matching) element, so the empty-subset shortcut does not apply:

```
classad_eval -quiet '[ a = stringListSize(" ") ]' a                    # 0  (empty list)
classad_eval -quiet '[ a = stringListSubsetMatch("", "a") ]' a         # true  (empty subset)
classad_eval -quiet '[ a = stringListSubsetMatch(" ", "a") ]' a        # false (!!)  -- " " acts non-empty
```

Since `" "` and `""` both have size 0, the empty list `" "` might be expected to
be a subset of `{ "a" }` just like `""` is. The reference disagrees only for a
whitespace-only (or otherwise all-delimiter, e.g. `","`) **non-empty** string,
treating it as a single non-matchable element. This is internally inconsistent
in libclassad (`size` says 0, `subsetMatch` acts as if 1).

The Go engine **mirrors** this behavior for parity: `stringListSubsetMatch` of a
non-empty string that tokenizes to zero elements is `false`, while a genuinely
empty string (or `undefined`) is `true`. The reference value is pinned by
`TestCppQuirks` in `fuzz/oracle/cgo/quirks_test.go`, which evaluates these
inputs in libclassad itself — so if a future libclassad release changes this
(e.g. fixes the inconsistency), that test fails and flags the Go mirror and this
note for revision. It links libclassad, so run it with the build tag:
`CGO_ENABLED=1 go test -tags libclassad ./fuzz/oracle/cgo/`.

## 8. `int()` / `floor()` / `ceiling()` / `round()` of a non-finite or out-of-range real is undefined behavior — likely bug

`convertValueToIntegerValue` (src/classad/value.cpp) turns a real into an
integer with an **unguarded C++ cast**:

```cpp
case Value::REAL_VALUE:
    value.IsRealValue(rvalue);
    integerValue.SetIntegerValue((long long) rvalue);   // UB if !isfinite or |rvalue| >= 2^63

case Value::STRING_VALUE:
    ivalue = (long long) strtod(buf.c_str(), &end);      // same, e.g. int("nan")
```

Casting a `NaN`, `±Inf`, or out-of-`int64`-range `double` to `long long` is
undefined behavior in C++ (C++20 [conv.fpint]/1). The result is **CPU/compiler
dependent**:

| Input | x86-64 (`cvttsd2si`) | AArch64 (`fcvtzs`) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `int("nan")`  | `-9223372036854775808` (INT64_MIN) | `0` |
| `int("inf")`  | `-9223372036854775808` (INT64_MIN) | `9223372036854775807` (saturates) |
| `int("-inf")` | `-9223372036854775808` (INT64_MIN) | `-9223372036854775808` |
| `int("1e30")` | `-9223372036854775808` (INT64_MIN) | `9223372036854775807` (saturates) |

So the *same* HTCondor source produces different `int("nan")` results on an
x86-64 build vs. an ARM build. It is also reachable through arithmetic
(`int(0.0/0.0)`, `int(pow(10, 1000))`, integer-overflowing products, …), not
just string literals.

The Go engine does **not** mirror this — it cannot portably reproduce UB, and
mirroring one CPU's result would be wrong on another. `floatToInt64` picks a
sane, deterministic, platform-independent behavior (NaN → 0, +Inf → INT64_MAX,
−Inf/underflow → INT64_MIN — i.e. saturation). The differential fuzzer avoids
generating the trigger (the generator no longer emits `"inf"`/`"nan"`/`"1e30"`
literals), because comparing a UB result against any fixed choice is
meaningless. This is a good candidate to fix upstream by guarding the cast
(range-check + `isnan`/`isinf`).

## 9. `=?=` / `=!=` between two lists depends on their internal representation — likely bug

`=?=` (and `=!=`) between two list operands is **error** when both lists have
the same internal representation, but **false** when they differ:

```
classad_eval -quiet '[ a = ({1} =?= {1}) ]' a                              # error
classad_eval -quiet '[ L = splitSlotName("a@b"); a = (L =?= L) ]' a        # error
classad_eval -quiet '[ L = splitSlotName("a@b"); a = ({1} =?= L) ]' a      # false (!!)
classad_eval -quiet '[ a = ({1} =?= split("x")) ]' a                       # false (!!)
```

A `{...}` literal is an `ExprList`, while a list *returned by a function*
(`split`, `splitSlotName`, `splitUserName`, …) is an `SList`. `=?=` compares the
two operands' internal type tags: same tag (two `ExprList`s, or two `SList`s) is
an unsupported list comparison → error, but different tags (`ExprList` vs
`SList`) look like a type mismatch → false. So the result of `X =?= Y` depends
on *how the lists were produced*, not just their contents.

The Go engine has a single list type, so `list =?= list` is consistently
`error` (it never sees a spurious type mismatch). It does **not** mirror this —
reproducing it would mean tagging list values with their origin purely to copy
a representation leak. Go's behavior matches the reference for the same-tag
cases and differs only for the mixed literal-vs-function case.

## 10. The number lexer is strtod-lenient and accepts a doubled leading dot — likely bug

libclassad's numeric-literal scanner is lenient (strtod-based) and accepts a
doubled leading dot that a stricter parser rejects:

```
classad_eval -quiet '[ x = ..5 ]' x     # 0.0   (doubled leading dot)
```

`..5` scans as `0.0`, while `.5.5`, `1..5`, `1.2.3`, `5.`, `..`, and `1.e5` are
all (correctly) rejected. The Go lexer requires a well-formed float -- a digit
on the fractional side of the dot and after any exponent -- so it rejects `..5`.
This is not mirrored; the differential parser fuzzer allowlists it as
CPP_QUIRKS #10. (Note: `.e5` is *not* a malformed float -- it is a leading-dot
reference to the attribute `e5`, which the Go parser now handles.)

## 11. The parser leniently recovers from unbalanced/mismatched brackets — likely bug

libclassad's parser accepts some inputs with unbalanced or mismatched brackets,
recovering to a partial result, where a strict parser reports a syntax error:

```
classad_eval -quiet '[ A = {(0?[0:0)} ]' A     # { 0 }  -- note the mismatched "[" ... ")"
```

The Go parser rejects such input. This is a libclassad leniency, not mirrored;
the differential parser fuzzer allowlists parse disagreements whose input has
unbalanced brackets as CPP_QUIRKS #11.

## 12. Error recovery accepts a dangling binary operator before a ternary ':' — likely bug

Inside a conditional expression, libclassad's parser recovers from a then-branch
whose trailing binary operator has no right operand, treating the malformed
`then` as complete when it reaches the `:`:

```
classad_eval -quiet '[ a = b ? c % : d ]' a    # undefined  -- note the "% :" (modulo with no RHS)
```

The same operator-missing-operand text outside a conditional (`[a = 1 % : 2]`)
is rejected by both engines; only the ternary's error-recovery path accepts it.
A well-formed then-expression never ends in a binary operator, so the Go parser
rejects the input. This is a libclassad leniency, not mirrored; the differential
parser fuzzer allowlists parse disagreements whose input has a binary operator
immediately before a ':' as CPP_QUIRKS #12.

## Observed (reasonable) semantics, recorded for completeness

These are not bugs, but were non-obvious and are now matched by the Go engine:

- **Unknown function ⇒ error without evaluating arguments.** `0 =!= A((x))`
  is `true` (the unknown `A` errors before its cyclic/erroring argument is
  evaluated).
- **Wrong-arity call ⇒ error without evaluating arguments.** `pow(x)` is error
  without evaluating `x`; `sum()`, `avg()`, `min()`, `max()` (0 args) are error.
- **Attribute selection over a list projects element-wise.** `{[A=1],[A=2]}.A`
  is `{1, 2}`; a non-ad element projects to `error`, a missing attribute to
  `undefined`.
- **A list value is its unevaluated `ExprList`.** `size({C})` counts elements
  (`1`) without evaluating `C`; string-coercion unparses the source expressions
  (`string({1, 1+1})` is `"{ 1,1 + 1 }"`).
