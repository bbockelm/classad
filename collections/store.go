	// Shards is the number of independently-locked shards; rounded up to a power

	Shards int
	// AppendOnly makes the collection a pure append log: every Put appends a new
	// record (no per-key supersession, no directory, no compaction, no deletes) --
	// the model a history archive needs. Records accumulate in commit order and are
	// reclaimed only by whole-segment retention, not compaction. Scan/Query see every
	// appended record; Get/Delete-by-key are not meaningful (there is no key index).
	AppendOnly bool
	// ReverseScan makes Scan/Query yield records newest-first (most recently
	// appended first) instead of in stored order. It walks segments from the last
	// (newest) backward and, within a segment, records back-to-front -- the natural
	// "last K" order a history archive presents (condor_history shows the most
	// recent jobs first). A consumer that stops early (yield/emit returns false)
	// after K records therefore gets the K newest, a pushed-down LIMIT. Reverse
	// scans always run serial (never fan out). Default false ⇒ stored order.
	// Most meaningful with AppendOnly, where stored order is commit order.
	ReverseScan bool
	// Retention bounds how much an AppendOnly collection keeps: Rotate(now) drops
	// whole oldest segments until the collection is back within these bounds (a
	// history archive's aging-out). The zero value keeps everything (Rotate is
	// then inert). Only meaningful with AppendOnly. See Rotate.
	Retention Retention
	// IndexBackfillBytes bounds how far back an index configuration change is carried. When
	// set, only segments within the newest IndexBackfillBytes have their existing index
	// rebuilt under a new configuration; older ones keep the index they already have.
	//
	// The point is that rebuilding is not free -- it decompresses every record it covers --
	// while an out-of-date index is still perfectly usable for the attributes it does hold
	// (recovery uses whatever a segment's index covers, deciding per probe). On an archive
	// queried newest-first with a limit, the oldest segments may never be reached at all, so
	// re-indexing them buys little and costs the whole archive.

	// 0 carries a change across every segment, which is the historical behaviour.
	IndexBackfillBytes int64

	// InternAtSeal makes an AppendOnly collection intern each segment as soon as it
	// seals (when the active segment fills), rather than only when RetrainDict/Rewrite
	// later reseal it. Interning stores segment-local ids + a per-segment name dictionary
	// instead of inline names, halving raw mmap bytes and speeding decode (see the
	// interning design). This trades a per-seal transcode (off the write lock) for the
	// density/decode win landing immediately on an archive that never retrains. Only
	// meaningful with AppendOnly (a mutable segment's records can be superseded in place,
	// which an off-lock transcode would race -- there interning rides compaction instead).
	// Optional; default off preserves exactly today's behavior. See InternSealed.
	InternAtSeal bool
	// ZoneAttrs names numeric attributes to keep a per-segment [min,max] zone map on,

	HotAttrs []string
	// MatchClosureRoots names attributes (typically "Requirements") whose transitive

	MatchClosureRoots []string
	// GroupSchemaCount is how many SECONDARY columnar schemas to derive and build alongside the

	// the table: measured on a production AP, a history table's base schema covers 90.3% of
	// attribute occurrences until jobs removed before ever running are mixed in, at which point
	// it falls to 51.3%, while base plus four groups holds 87-94% across the range. Enabling by

	// ColumnarSegmentBudget is how many sealed segments one maintenance pass may rewrite into
	// COLUMNAR-NATIVE form -- each attribute the schema carries stored once, in the segment's own
	// columnar payload, and removed from the records (see colnative.go). 0 uses
	// defaultColumnarBudget; a NEGATIVE value disables the rewrite and keeps every segment
	// whole-record with a columnar copy beside it in the sidecar.
	//
	// On by default because the duplication is pure cost: without it every value the schema
	// carries is stored twice, row-form in the arena and again in the sidecar block. Measured on
	// 1500 real OSPool machine ads, moving them removed 43% of the table (4104 -> 2327 bytes per
	// record), and the sidecar megabyte it reclaimed was entirely the duplicate copy.
	//
	// Budgeted rather than unbounded because turning it on over an existing archive rewrites every
	// sealed segment once, and at history scale doing that in a single pass is hours of I/O and a

	// GroupMaxPartialFrac bounds the fraction of ads that may then hold only PART of a group and
	// take the slow path for it; 0 uses defaultGroupMaxPartial.
	//
	// Measured against a later snapshot of the same table, widening still recovered more than
	// exact grouping (25.14% of attribute occurrences against 23.53%), because a partial ad reads
	// from the cold tail -- where it would have read anyway -- rather than paying a penalty. The
