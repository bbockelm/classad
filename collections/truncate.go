// segments are munmap'd + unlinked once no in-flight scan references them (the compaction
// pin/reap protocol). A concurrent scan that already captured its window reads the old
// data safely until it finishes; scans and writes that start after Truncate see an empty
// collection. Ordered indexes are cleared in place. Callers needing atomicity against
// concurrent writers must serialize Truncate with them (the db layer holds its DB-wide
// lock); at the shard level Truncate is itself consistent.
