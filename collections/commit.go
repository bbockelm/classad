// Group commit. Concurrent writers to a shard are coalesced so that a batch of
// writes is applied under a single commitSeq bump and a single durability sync.
// Today the store is in-memory and the sync is a no-op, so coalescing is roughly
// a wash; it exists so that a future durable-serialization feature (fsync/write
// of the batch) is amortized across all writers that commit together, instead of
// paying the sync once per writer.
//
// The protocol is leader/handoff:
//   - A writer with no commit in progress becomes the flusher and applies its
//     writes directly (the uncontended fast path — no queue, no channels).
//   - Writers arriving while a flush is in progress enqueue and block.
//   - When a flusher finishes, if others are queued it drains and applies them all
//     as one batch (coalescing = everyone who arrived during the previous sync),
//     then hands the flusher role to one of them. Each flusher applies at most one
//     batch, so no writer is trapped committing for others indefinitely.

// pendingPut is one encoded, compressed write awaiting commit.
